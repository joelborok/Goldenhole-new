			Kolos is an online platform for young students who want to pursue their further studies but are unsure of what to take up and where to seek advice from whom regarding the different fields of studies and the opportunities that comes with them.
			It is common for most students doing their secondary and higher secondary to be confused with the career options that they should pursue and the degrees they need to choose to reach their goals. So, here at Kolos, our objective is to bring help and awareness to such students but connecting them with different counsellors who are studying or have studied and graduated in different fields of studies.
			The students can have access to counselling and enlightenment regarding to the subjects of their interest through interaction with these counsellors. The interaction will happen through various means of communication and even through meetings which will be setup by Kolos.
